## Getting Started

The project is a Node project.

Please make sure that you have it installed it on your local machine.

To install all necessary npm modules run:
`npm install`

Start up the server by running
`npm start`

Now the local server should have started.
Now you should have access to local server at: `http://localhost:8080/`
Navigate your browser to: `http://localhost:8080/app` to preview your project.

It will watch for all the changes in `src/less` directory - however it won't auto-reload your browser.
